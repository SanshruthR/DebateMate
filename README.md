## Overview

**DebateMate** is a strategic debate arena where words fuel your chess moves. It combines the intellectual challenge of debate with the tactical gameplay of chess. Users define a strategic objective, and the AI challenger responds with thought-provoking questions or challenges. Each response is rated, and the debate progresses alongside a chess game, where the quality of your arguments influences your moves on the board.

## Features

- **Strategic Debate**: Define your plan or objective, and engage in a debate with an AI challenger.
- **Chess Integration**: Every debate round influences a chess game. Strong arguments lead to better moves!
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Receive ratings for your responses based on their strategic quality.
- **Interactive Interface**: A sleek, modern UI with a chessboard and chat interface for seamless interaction.
- **AI-Powered Challenges**: The AI challenger provides concise, thought-provoking questions to test your strategy.

## How It Works

1. **Define Your Plan**: Enter your strategic objective or plan in the input field.
2. **Start the Debate**: The AI challenger will respond with a critical question or challenge.
3. **Respond Strategically**: Type your response to the challenge. Your response will be rated for its strategic quality.
4. **Influence the Chess Game**: Based on your response rating, make a move on the chessboard. The AI will also make a move based on its challenge.
5. **Win the Debate**: The debate continues until the chess game concludes or the debate reaches a set number of rounds.
